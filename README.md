# Feedback text note body:
Thank you so much for this amazing detailed introduction! I truly learned a lot from it and appreciate this a lot. I have serveral recommendations though. 
It might worth consider simplifying the example by removing some echo steps and focusing on the core checkout and list files steps while listing what they exactly do in the documentation.
For someone who is not familiar with workflow, these echo steps can be confusing to understand. 
Also, it would be helpful to show an example (screenshot) after a user has pushed some requests into the workflow and how that is updated accordingly.
